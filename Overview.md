The schema leverages SurrealDB's multi-model capabilities, using a combination of document and graph models to represent complex project structures and relationships.

## 7. Development Workflow

1. User inputs project requirements (via CLI, Web, or API)
2. AI analyzes requirements and determines project type
3. System selects appropriate code generation strategy and templates
4. AI assists in populating templates and generating custom code
5. System generates full project structure, including documentation and tests
6. Output is provided to the user, ready for further customization or deployment

## 8. Future Enhancements

- Real-time collaboration features
- Integration with popular IDEs
- Machine learning model for continuous improvement of code generation
- Expanded support for emerging technologies and frameworks

## 9. Conclusion

CodeForge aims to revolutionize the software development process by providing a flexible, AI-powered system for rapidly generating high-quality software projects across a wide range of types and technologies.
